# My current Neovim and Ghostty terminal configurations

basically used tokyo night preset from starship prompt , and Lazyvim for Neovim config management.

i only know somewhat of Rust development so have only added Rust plugins and LSP for simple and clean development. and this just works so i am happay for now.

NOTE :

you'll have to add starship prompt to path ( in .zshrc or .zprofile) .

check installation guide for both neovim and starship prompts , easy to install , just follow
